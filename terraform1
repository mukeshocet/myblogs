CI/CD - Pipeline 


Components of pipeline 





Procedural vs Declarative 





Using Terraform we would use declarative approach to specify what are our infrastructure needs => Infrastructure as Code (IaC)




Terraform is Cloud-agnostic because deploy to any cloud or virtual infra provider



Install terraform :

First install homebrew for mac and chocolaty for windows

Mac => brew => brew install terraform

Windows => choco => choco install terraform -y


Terraform Terminologies

	• Provider: This specifies terraform where to create infrastructure
	• Resource: Resources are the core elements of your infrastructure.
		○ The inputs which we specify about the resource are called as arguments
		○ When we create resources using terraform they specify some outputs of the resource which are called as attributes
	• DataSource: This helps us in querying information (about resources) from terraform configuration.
	
Writing a Terraform Configuration file

	• We need to specify the provider
		• Syntax:
		
		provider "<name-of-provider>" {
    arg1 = "value1"
    ...
    ..
    argn = "value2"
}
	
	• We need to find a right resource from the provider
	
		resource "<resource-type>" "<resource-name>" {
    arg1 = "value1"
      ...
      ..
      argn = "value2"
		}
	• Hello World Configuration
	
	provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west-2"
}
	resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
    bucket = "my-tf-qt-s3-bucket"
    acl = "private"
}
Activity: From Terraform Create an S3 bucket in AWS Cloud

	• Manual Steps:
		• Login into AWS Console
		• Follow the steps 
		
		
		 
		
		 
		
		 
		
		 
		
	
	• Approach in Terraform
		• Find the Provider: 
		
		
		 
		
		
		• How to configure authentication 
		
		
		
		• Find a resource in AWS Provider to Create S3 bucket
